# Dijkstra's Algorithms in C

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the second year 'Algorithms and Numerical Methods' spring term module - Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York (2019).

Coded in CLion and ported to Code::Blocks.

Algorithm is completely parameterizable to the data input, with the program successfully running 1,376 unique city nodes with approximately 32,000 connections before memory leakage on a 2.2GHz quad-core i7 2015 Macbook Pro.

Program was awarded full marks.
